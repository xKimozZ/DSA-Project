# DSA-Project
Process Scheduler Project for Data Structures and Algorithms course

Process Scheduler, Cairo University, Faculty of Engineering, Cairo (February 2023-May 2023):

Provided an opportunity for me to write my most complicated program so far in C++ completely from scratch and apply my understanding of data structures and algorithms. Received 15 out of 15 points.

•	We were tasked with building a Process Scheduling emulator in C++ completely from scratch without using any existing code, entailing heavy use of data structures like queues (and modifications to them), stacks, and trees for process forking

•	I developed the FCFS processor, process forking, and process migration modules -- building a robust and maintainable framework that ensures the processor will always aim for maximum utilization of resources, and that SIGKILL signals abide by the given rules

•	Received 15 out of 15 points
